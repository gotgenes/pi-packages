   * `salvagedRoots` are regions the primary parse could not resolve, re-parsed
   * cleanly on their own (`unresolved-salvage.ts`, #875). Their candidates are
   * collected into the same array before projection runs, so a path both a

   * showing twice in the prompt. Each is walked under the **unknown** base: a
   * fragment carries no record of the `cd` in force where it sat, and
   * resolving `cat rel.txt` against the session cwd after `cd /outside` would
   * name a different file than the one that runs — a rule for that other path
   * could then allow this access. #393's unknown base declines the claim
   * instead, keeping an absolute token literal-only and unconditionally
   * external while a relative one is not projected at all.
   *
   * A token spelled from a `HOME` the program rebinds leaves both slices before
   * projection: path normalization would otherwise expand its `~`/`$HOME` prefix
   * to the startup home, naming a directory the shell never touches.
   *
   * The argument spellings come from the same projection as the rule
   * candidates, keyed by the source span of a whole-argument token. A salvaged
   * fragment's tokens carry no span, because its indices are its own re-parse's
   * and would collide with the primary tree's.
